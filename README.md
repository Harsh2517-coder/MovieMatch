# MovieMatch
A personalized movie recommendation system built using Python. It features a secure CAPTCHA-based login and CSV-based user authentication. After logging in, users are guided through a short questionnaire to assess their mood, time preferences, and genre interests. Based on these inputs, the system suggests movies tailored to each userâ€™s profile.
